# DEPLOYMENT
# =============================================================================

# Every sensor will have its own deployment instance, rather than being deployed
#   as part of a group of sensors.  This allows for easier cleaning, maintenance,
#   installation and removal deployment related processes to be created.  It is 
#   not possible to restrict the amount of sub-systems however, for example, to
#   say that a deployment is for a system that has no sub-systems, as a single
#   hardware entity such as a sonde, can be made up of multiple sensors that are
#   contained within a single unit.
#
# A sensor can be deployed multiple times however, so the inverse relationship
#   is not functional.
