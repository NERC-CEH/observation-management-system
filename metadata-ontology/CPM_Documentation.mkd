In the CPM there are contradictory examples in the use of matrix and object of interest.  For example, in Table 4 they show the "surface elevation" property for the "water body" matrix, but in table 5 they show the "level" property for the "water" object of interest.  The second approach appears more rational in that the level is a property of the water, rather than the level being within the water body, as there can be continuous levels within a water body depending on how you define the top and bottom.

There also appears to be overloading of the matrix property, with examples using "lake water" or "water body".  If "lake water" is used, for example as the matrix to the concentration of carbon, we are losing the ability to facet a search on only water or lakes.  If the vocabulary concepts are setup correctly then we likely would be able to navigate the relationships as part of a search, however the CPM and OP seem to exist to atomise as much of a property as possible; the mixing of distinct subjects within matrix is unappealing.  To negate this, the feature of interest concept from OP is used, which is used to represent the feature realm the property is associated with.  So the matrix can be water, and the feature a lake.

There is still some uncertainty about some properties, such as atmospheric pressure.  This is the property "pressure", for the object "atmosphere", but this is measured in the "atmosphere", leading to double use of "atmosphere" for both the object and matrix.  For other properties such as "dew point" or "relative humidity", these can conceivably be represented by either or both matrix and object of interest.  For example, the dew point is a property of the atmosphere, or it could be a property that is observed in the atmosphere, similar to relative humidity in this respect.
